- PLEASE: classnames should not be strings with new lines.
- PLEASE: classnames trailing/precieding spaces AND double spacing.

- Remove any plugins in VSCode that messup the spacing (if you plan to use it as an excuse later :D )
- Add mocks to frontend so that it's not Backend-depentent
- catch then throw directly without editing is not needed
- primary - secondary - danger in the button could be one string/type prop
- components/Chat => ChatPreview
- check curved chatbox on mobile
- BACKEND: with InmemoryRepository testing, we can have a function called (seed) that takes UserRepository var and Messages...repo chat..repo and fill then with static testibg data
- check avatar width/height overwriting
- let's always separate props interface
- input onChange is not optional
- SearchBar => search/setSearch => value/onChange
- replace Sidebar to use flex over absolute/relative
- you can have components/Sidebar folder, and have inside of it: index.tsx Header.tsx Skeleton...
- userChats.map conditions are not needed
- POST /chats to be added to actions
- onEvent vs handleEvent (with optional explaining word in the middle like: onCloseClick, onAddClick same with handle)
- Please remove JSX unintended spaces
